# Product Requirements Document: MCP Monitoring Dashboard

## Executive Summary
A web-based dashboard application that provides real-time monitoring and control capabilities for the Multi-Agent Claude Code (MCP) system. The dashboard will be accessible from any device, including mobile phones, and provide insights into agent activities, project progress, and system health.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there's no unified interface to:
- Monitor the activities of multiple Claude Code agents
- Track project progress across different worktrees
- Analyze RAG store contents and usage patterns
- Control agent behavior and coordination
- View real-time logs and metrics

## Solution Overview
A modern, responsive web dashboard built with Next.js that connects to the MCP system and provides comprehensive monitoring and control capabilities.

## User Personas
1. **Developer/Orchestrator**: Needs to monitor agent progress, debug issues, and control agent behavior
2. **Project Manager**: Wants to track project completion, view metrics, and understand bottlenecks
3. **System Administrator**: Requires system health monitoring, resource usage tracking, and configuration management

## Core Features

### 1. Agent Monitoring
- **Real-time Status**: Show current status of each agent (idle, working, blocked)
- **Activity Feed**: Live stream of agent actions with timestamps
- **Git Activity**: Display recent commits, branch status, and merge conflicts
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, task completion rate, error frequency

### 2. Project Management
- **Project Overview**: List all projects with completion status
- **Task Board Visualization**: Interactive view of task-board.json
- **Progress Tracking**: Burndown charts and velocity metrics
- **File Explorer**: Browse project files across different worktrees

### 3. RAG Store Analytics
- **Content Browser**: Search and view stored memories
- **Usage Statistics**: Most accessed patterns, storage growth
- **Query Performance**: Search response times and hit rates
- **Content Categories**: Breakdown by type (architecture, implementation, testing)

### 4. Control Panel
- **Agent Commands**: Start/stop/restart individual agents
- **Configuration Editor**: Modify CLAUDE.md files and settings
- **Task Assignment**: Manually create and assign tasks
- **Emergency Controls**: Pause all agents, rollback changes

### 5. Communication Hub
- **Coordination Documents**: Live view of PROJECT_PLAN.md updates
- **Agent Messages**: Inter-agent communication logs
- **Notification System**: Alerts for errors, blockers, completions
- **Chat Interface**: Direct communication with individual agents

### 6. System Health
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk usage per agent
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error log with stack traces
- **Performance Graphs**: Historical performance data
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Agent availability tracking

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: Zustand or React Context
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization

### Backend
- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for server functionality
- **Database**: SQLite for metrics storage (lightweight, file-based)
- **File System API**: Direct access to MCP file structure
- **Git Integration**: Simple-git library for repository operations
- **Process Management**: Node.js child_process for agent control

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Vercel for easy deployment and scaling
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure access
- **Monitoring**: Integrated with Vercel Analytics
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration

## API Endpoints

### Agent Management
- `GET /api/agents` - List all agents with status
- `GET /api/agents/:id/logs` - Get agent logs
- `POST /api/agents/:id/control` - Start/stop agent
- `GET /api/agents/:id/metrics` - Performance metrics

### Project Management
- `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id/tasks` - Get task board
- `PUT /api/projects/:id/tasks` - Update tasks
- `GET /api/projects/:id/files` - Browse files

### RAG Store
- `GET /api/rag/search` - Search memories
- `GET /api/rag/stats` - Usage statistics
- `POST /api/rag/query` - Execute RAG query

### System
- `GET /api/system/health` - System health check
- `GET /api/system/metrics` - Resource usage
- `GET /api/system/config` - Configuration

## Security Considerations
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (viewer, operator, admin)
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Performance Requirements
- Dashboard load time: <2 seconds
- Real-time updates: <100ms latency
- Support 10+ concurrent users
- Handle 1000+ tasks in task board
- Search response: <500ms

## Success Metrics
- Agent productivity increase: 20%
- Error detection time: -50%
- Project completion visibility: 100%
- User satisfaction: >4.5/5
