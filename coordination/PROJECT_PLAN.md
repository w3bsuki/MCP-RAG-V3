# Multi-Agent Development Project Plan

## Project Overview
Autonomous 3-agent Claude Code system for converting PRDs into production applications.

## System Architecture
- **Architect Agent**: Requirements analysis, system design, coordination
- **Builder Agent**: Full-stack implementation (frontend, backend, database)
- **Validator Agent**: Testing, quality assurance, deployment validation

## Coordination Protocol
1. All agents read this document before starting work
2. Updates committed to git with descriptive messages
3. Task assignments tracked in task-board.json
4. RAG store used for shared context and learnings

## Current Status
- Project initialized: 2025-06-16
- Git worktrees created for all agents
- MCP RAG server configured
- Ready for PRD input

## Next Steps
1. Architect: Analyze incoming PRD and create technical specifications
2. Builder: Wait for specifications from architect
3. Validator: Set up testing infrastructure

## Communication Guidelines
- Use task-board.json for task updates
- Query RAG before implementing new patterns
- Store successful implementations in RAG
- Commit frequently with clear messages

## Quality Standards
- Test coverage: >90%
- Security: All scans must pass
- Performance: Meet defined benchmarks
- Documentation: Update as needed

## Git Branch Strategy
- master: Coordination and shared resources
- agent-architect-*: Architect worktree
- agent-builder-*: Builder worktree  
- agent-validator-*: Validator worktree

## Deployment Process
1. Builder implements features
2. Validator runs comprehensive tests
3. Architect approves architecture
4. Deploy only after all checks pass
